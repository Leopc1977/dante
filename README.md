ðŸ§© Maze Generator & Solver

This project features a maze generator using the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm and a solver based on the A* (A-star) pathfinding algorithm.

The DFS algorithm generates perfect mazes (no loops, only one possible path between two points).

The A* algorithm efficiently finds the shortest path from the start to the end using heuristics.
